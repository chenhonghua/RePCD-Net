# RePCD-Net: Feature-aware Recurrent Point Cloud Denoising Network

### Introduction
This repository is for our International Journal of Computer Vision (IJCV) 2022 paper '[RePCD-Net: Feature-aware Recurrent Point Cloud Denoising Network](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11263-021-01564-7)'. 

### Denoised result
We have released some denoised results in our work, please feel free to use them.

### Synthtic test dataset
We have aslo released our synthetic test dataset for an easiser comparison for future researchers. For the quantitative statistics, please refer to the table 2 in this paper. Note also that this dataset is built based on the '[PU-GAN](https://liruihui.github.io/publication/PU-GAN/)'.

Code coming soon...
